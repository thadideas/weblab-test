/*yo notes!
IDEATION AND JS!!

what concepts make a viable product
diverge, converge, diverge, converge
1. blue sky --> lots, rough <tag yourself>
    Problem/Audience/Feature/Theme
    moodboard
    don't judge
    tinder but...
2. uh smthsmthsmth
    what is good, what is bad
3. Transition to viable product
    focus on BASIC concepts and features
    work toward simple MVP feat. killer features
    can we make this more interesting (gameify)
